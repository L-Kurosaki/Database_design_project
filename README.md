## 1. Introduction
A bus stop serving a large number of bus lines can experience a condition known as **bus stop failure** due to limited capacity and high passenger demand, which negatively affects the punctuality and reliability of bus services and causes delays to other traffic [1].

The **Kasi Bus Booking System (KBBS)** aims to address these challenges by providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly platform for booking bus tickets.
