## 1. Introduction
A bus stop serving a large number of bus lines can experience a condition known as **bus stop failure** due to limited capacity and high passenger demand, which negatively affects the punctuality and reliability of bus services and causes delays to other traffic [1].

The **Kasi Bus Booking System (KBBS)** aims to address these challenges by providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly platform for booking bus tickets. One of the **key features** of the system is **route scheduling and seat reservations**, which ensures real-time updates and efficient management of bus operations.

## üß© Database Normalization

### 1NF
- Split composite attributes like `Names` into `First_Name` and `Last_Name`  
- All attributes are atomic

### 2NF
- Eliminated partial dependencies in `Booking_Seat`  
- All relations with single-column PKs, so 2NF satisfied

### 3NF
- Removed transitive dependencies  
  - `Assigned_BusDriver_Name` ‚Üí `Driver` table  
  - `Assigned_Admin_Name` ‚Üí `Admin` table
